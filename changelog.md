# War of the Elements

## Build 2 (V0.0.1)

### Major Changes

After following a pretty useful tutorial for making card games, I wanted come through and clean the code up some. I have most of the stuff I need, it's just about putting it together. This is the hard part. Hopefully I can get it done in time.

* NEW ART. Took the time to put some art and card designs together. Some art borrowed from the internet.
* CARD DATABASE UPDATED with decks
* GLOBAL VARIABLES UPDATED to provide an opportunity for the deck choice to happen.
* MINIMAL UI. Found from Itch.IO
