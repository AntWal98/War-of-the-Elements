# War of the Elements

War of the Elements is a single-player turn-based card game designed with the inspiration of famous card games like Magic: the Gathering, Pokemon, and YuGiOh. This was created for the Godot Wild Jam (#77) based on the themes METAMORPHOSIS, with some wildcards that included dice rolls and exchanges. This was a tough venture, but I am very proud to have accomplished this!
